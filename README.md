# Biofeedback

Theses notebook explores codes and functions towards:
<ol>
    <li> The analysis of time series collected from a variety of wearable sensors.</li>
    <li> The testing and development of algorithms to reconstruct gait, joint angle, posture from wearable sensor data</li>
    <li> The development of biofeedback strategy for postural rehabilitation</li>
    </ol>
    
The sensors used in the study are:
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://mbientlab.com">mbientlab</a> IMU MetaMotionR+ including
        <ul>
            <li> accelerometer (m<sup>2</sup>/s)</li>
            <li> gyroscope (rad/s)</li>
            <li> magnetometer (T)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Garmin connect including
        <ul>
            <li> Power (W): Powertap P1 pedals </li>
            <li> Speed (m/s): Garmin speed sensor (attached on rear wheel hub)</li>
            <li> Cadence (rpm): Garmin cadence sensor (attached on left crank)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
